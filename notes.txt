There is a second branch with tailwind installed and working plus more example content.

Switch VSCode to this branch in the bottom left corner to access it.

I included Github README markdown style classes in css - wrap MDX or .md 
component like this to apply styles:

<div className='markdown-body'>
  <MDXcomponent />
</div>
